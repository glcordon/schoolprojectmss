# Themes

Wave has full theme support, which means you can separate your views into separate themes. This will make it easier to create new versions of your site and revert back if needed.

In this section we will only cover how to activate themes and where they are located. For full theme configuration options and to learn how to create your own theme be sure to visit [Themes Basic Concepts](/docs/{{version}}/basic-concepts/themes).

### Theme folder location

Every theme is located inside of the `resources/views/themes` folder. You will see there are currently 2 folders which include `bootstrap` and the `uikit` theme folders.
